Abstract
---
This work proposes Adaptive Facilitated Mutation, a self-adaptive mutation method for Structured Grammatical Evolution (SGE), biologically inspired by the theory of facilitated variation. In SGE, the genotype of individuals contains a list for each non-terminal of the grammar that defines the search space. In our proposed mutation, each individual contains an array with a different, self-adaptive mutation rate for each non-terminal. We also propose Function Grouped Grammars, a grammar design procedure to enhance the benefits of the propose mutation. Experiments were conducted on three symbolic regression benchmarks using Probabilistic Structured Grammatical Evolution (PSGE), a variant of SGE. Results show our approach is similar or better when compared with the standard grammar and mutation.
