I am a PhD student at the University of Coimbra, Portugal, and I work as a researcher for the Evolutionary and Complex Systems (ECOS) group of the Centre for Informatics and Systems of the University of Coimbra (CISUC).

I am the author of Probabilistic Grammatical Evolution and some variants, and it will continue to be the main focus of my research. I like to hear other researchersâ€™ opinions and discuss ideas, so feel free to get in touch!
